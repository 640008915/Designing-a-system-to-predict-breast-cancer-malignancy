# Designing-a-system-to-predict-breast-cancer-malignancy
Coding machine learning algorithms to predict whether a breast cancer is benign or malignant using tumour nuclei data the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.

Focusing on comparing performance of scikit-learn algorithms, with and without feature selection, against "from scratch"/independently coded logistic regression.
